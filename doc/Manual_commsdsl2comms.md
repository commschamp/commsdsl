# Manual of **commsdsl2comms**

## Overview
The **commsdsl2comms** is main code generation tool provided by this project. 
It generates headers only protocol definition code defined using 
[CommsDSL](https://commschamp.github.io/commsdsl_spec/) schema file(s).

Note that the output of the **commsdsl2comms** is CMake project which 
can be used to install all the necessary files (protocol definition 
headers as well as CMake confiugration files) into the installation directory.

## Command Line Arguments
The **commsdsl2comms** utility has multiple command line arguments, please
use `-h` option for the full list as well as default option values. 

```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms -h
```
Below is a summary of most important ones.

### Selecting Schema Files
In case there are only few schema files, it is possible to pass them 
at the end of the arguments list.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms <args> schema1.xml schema2.xml schema3.xml ...
```
The schema files will be processed **in order** of their listing.

In case there are lots of schema files (for example every message 
is defined in separate schema file), it is recommended to create a separate
text file with list of all schema files and use `-i` option.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms -i schemas_list.txt ...
```
The schemas in the list file may use use *absolute* or *relative* path. In case
of the latter please also provide absolute path prefix using `-p` option. The
prefix will be prepended to every relative path inside the list file to locate
the schema file.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms -i schemas_list.txt -p /path/to/schemas/dir ...
```

### Output Directory
By default the output CMake project is written to the current directory. It
is possible to change that using `-o` option.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms -o /some/output/dir schema.xml
```

### Injecting Custom Code
The **commsdsl2comms** utility allows injection of custom C++ code into the
generated one in case the default code is incorrect and/or incomplete. For this
purpose `-c` option with path to directory containing custom code snippets is used.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms -c /path/to/custom/code/snippets schema.xml
```
Please read [Custom Code](#custom-code) section below for more details on
how to format and where to place the custom code.

### Changing Main Namespace
By default the protocol name defined in the schema file(s) is used as the 
main namespace for the generated code. It is possible to change it using
`-n` option.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms -n other_ns_name schema.xml
```

### Selecting Protocol Version
The schema file(s) is expected to specify protocol numeric version. By default
the generated code will be for the latest version including all the fields that
were introduced at some stage and omitting all the deprecated and removed 
ones. However, the **commsdsl2comms**
utility allows generation of the code for any version of the protocol by using
`--force-schema-version` option. 
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms --force-schema-version 2 schema.xml
```

### Selecting Minimal Remote Version
For version dependent protocols (where the used protocol version is reported 
to the other side in transport framing or payload of one of the messages), the
assumed minimal remote version is **0**. In means all the fields that were
introduced at later stage will be *optional* ones that can exist or be missing.
If it is known for sure that the other side of communication won't use some early 
versions, it is possible to generate more efficient code by passing `-m` option.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms -m 5 schema.xml
```
In the example above, all the fields that were introduced before or in version **5**,
will be *regular* ones (instead of *optional*).

### Customization Level
The code generated by the **commsdsl2comms** utility can allow extra
compile time customizations (such as choosing custom storage type and/or
having extra functionality). There are 3 levels of available customizations:
- **full** - All fields and messages are going to be customizable.
- **limited** - Only variable length fields (such as `<string>`, `<data>`,
and `<list>`) and uni-directional messages will be customizable.
- **none** - No fields or messages will allow extra compile time customization.

The recommended (and default) customization level is **limited**. However, when
protocol schema being developed (i.e. new fields / and messages are being 
constantly added) it is recommended to temporarily use **none** as customization level in
order to reduce (re)compilation times of the target project.

The customization level can be selected using `--customization` option.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms --customization=none schema.xml
```

### Custom Bundling of Messages
The **commsdsl2comms** utility creates multiple bundles of messages based
on their direction (server vs client) as well as relevant code for dispatching
messages from such bundles to appropriate handlers. It is possible to provide
extra independent list of message types for extra bundles and extra relevant
dispatching code generation. For such purpose `\n` separated list of message
names needs to be created in a separate file and `--extra-messages-bundle` option
to be used. The format of the option value is
`Name@File`, where `Name` is the name of the bundle, while `File` is a path
to file containing message names (as defined in CommsDSL schema). The `Name`
part can be omitted resulting in the name be deduced from the specified file name.
To specify multiple bundles use comma separation
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2comms --extra-messages-bundle=Set1:extra-set1.txt,Set2:extra-set2.txt schema.xml
```

## Custom Code
As was already mentioned earlier, **commsdsl2comms** utility allows injection
of custom C++11 code snippets in the generated code. The 
[Injecting Custom Code](#injecting-custom-code) section above described `-c`
option that can be used to specify directory with custom code snippets. 
Every file inside that directory must have the same relative path to the file its
going to update, as the generated file inside the output directory.

Every global **field** and/or **message** class will be defined in a separate 
file and will have the following basic operations:
- **construct** - Construction
- **read** - Read operation
- **write** - Write operation
- **length** - Serialization length calculation
- **valid** - Contained value validity check
- **refresh** - Bring the contents into consistent state
- **name** - Get a descriptive name of the field / message

In order to replace the default implementation of any of these operations, 
the file with the same name (and relative path) must be created, but also have
additional suffix with the operation name. For example let's assume we have
protocol named **demo**, with message **Msg1**. The class for the message
will reside in `include/demo/message/Msg1.h`. In order to replace the default **read**
operation, there is a need to create `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.read` file
which will define custom read function. Following the same logic to
replace all the operations there is a need to have the following files:
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.construct`
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.read`
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.write`
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.length`
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.valid`
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.refresh`
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.name`

The constructor must contain the actual class name. For the other
functions they differ between **fields** and **messages**.

Note that for **fields** the provided functions are expected to have the
following signatures.
```cpp
template <typename TIter>
comms::ErrorStatus read(TIter& iter, std::size_t len);

template <typename TIter>
comms::ErrorStatus write(TIter& iter, std::size_t len) const;

std::size_t length() const;

bool valid() const;

bool refresh();

static const char* name();
```

For **messages** it is similar, but with `do*` prefix.
```cpp
template <typename TIter>
comms::ErrorStatus doRead(TIter& iter, std::size_t len);

template <typename TIter>
comms::ErrorStatus dowrite(TIter& iter, std::size_t len) const;

std::size_t doLength() const;

bool doValid() const;

bool doRefresh();

static const char* doName();
```
It is also possible to add unrelated custom code to **public**, **protected**,
and/or **private** areas by using relevant suffix.
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.public`
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.protected`
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.private`

In case there is a need for a custom destructor and/or assignment operator,
use either **.construct** or **.public** code injection to define them.

The custom operation may required additional includes, which may be provided by
using appropriate definition file with **.inc** suffix. The contents of this
file will be added after all the default includes.
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.inc`

It may happen that provided above customization options are not sufficient, and
need to be completely rewritten. In this case it is possible to create appropriate file
with **.replace** suffix, contents of which will completely replace the file
generated by **commsdsl2comms**.
- `include/demo/message/Msg1.h.replace`

The **commsdsl2comms** also allows to reuse the class it generates by default
and extend the existing functionality with the new one. It can be achieved by
defining a file with **.extend** suffix. Similar to **.replace**, it must define
the full class, but it is expected to extend and reuse default definition which
will have **Orig** suffix added to its name.
```cpp
class Msg1 : public Msg1Orig {...};
```

There are cases when **commsdsl2comms** cannot generate some pieces of code and
they must be provided externally. For example, custom checksum algorithm and/or
custom framing layer. The custom definition files are expected to be
found in the following relative paths:
- `include/<main_namespace>/frame/checksum/<checksum_name>.h`
- `include/<main_namespace>/frame/layer/<layer_name>.h`

The example of checksum definition can be found at
[UbloxChecksum.h](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.ublox.commsdsl/blob/master/src/include/ublox/frame/checksum/UbloxChecksum.h)
file from [cc.ublox.commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.ublox.commsdsl) 
protocol definition.

The example of custom layer can be found 
at [IdAndFlags.h](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqtt311.commsdsl/blob/master/src/include/mqtt311/frame/layer/IdAndFlags.h)
file from [cc.mqtt311.commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqtt311.commsdsl)
protocol definition (defines custom ID layer that also contains extra flags) or
at [Length.h](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqttsn.commsdsl/blob/master/src/include/mqttsn/frame/layer/Length.h)
file from [cc.mqttsn.commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqttsn.commsdsl)
protocol definition.

Please note that custom layer that replaces `<id>` one is expected to use
the following template parameters.
```cpp
/// @tparam TField Used field type
/// @tparam TMessage Interface class
/// @tparam TAllMessages Input messages
/// @tparam TNext Layer Next frame layer
/// @tparam TExtraOpt Extra options passed to @b comms::MsgFactory
template <
    typename TField,
    typename TMessage,
    typename TAllMessages,
    typename TNextLayer,
    typename... TExtraOpt>
class MyIdLayer : public ...
{
    ...
};
```
Any other custom layer is expected to use the following template parameters
```cpp
/// @tparam TField Used field type
/// @tparam TNext Layer Next frame layer
/// @tparam TExtraOpt Extra options passed to the base class
template <
    typename TField,
    typename TNextLayer,
    typename... TExtraOpts>
class MyCustomLayer : public ...
{
    ...
};
```
**NOTE**, that customization is available for **global** fields (including ones
that defined in any separate namespace) as well as messages. At this stage
injecting custom code to the fields defined inside message body is not supported.

For more code customization examples it is recommended to take a look at
the following real-life protocols.
- [cc.mqtt311.commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqtt311.commsdsl/blob/master/src)
- [cc.mqtt5.commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqtt5.commsdsl/blob/master/src)
- [cc.mqttsn.commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqttsn.commsdsl/blob/master/src)
- [cc.ublox.commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.ublox.commsdsl/blob/master/src)

The **commsdsl2comms** also allows appending any text to any generated file
(not necessarily C++ code). It is done by creating appropriate file
with **.append** suffix. For example, adding extra logic to the generated CMake
file(s) are possible by creating `CMakeLists.txt.append` file with custom 
content.

The **commsdsl2comms** utility will also copy all the files, residing in the
source directory and not having any of the special suffixes (**.read**, **.write**,
**.length**, etc...), as-is without modification into the output directory 
preserving their relative path.
