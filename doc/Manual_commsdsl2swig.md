# Manual of **commsdsl2swig**

## Overview
The **commsdsl2swig** is a code generation tool provided by this project.
It generates CMake project that can be used to build bindings allowing
usage of the protocol definition C++ code, generated by the **commsdsl2comms**, to be
used in other higher level programming languages, such as Python, Java, C#, etc...

## Command Line Arguments
The **commsdsl2swig** utility has multiple command line arguments, please
use `-h` option for the full list as well as default option values. 

```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2swig -h
```
Below is a summary of most important ones.

### Selecting Schema Files
Selecting of the schema files is very similar to how it is done for the
[commsdsl2comms](Manual_commsdsl2comms.md#selecting-schema-files).

List all the schema files at the end of the command line arguments:

```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2swig <args> schema1.xml schema2.xml schema3.xml ...
```
The schema files will be processed **in order** of their listing.

When the input files are listed in the single file:
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2swig -i schemas_list.txt
```

When a schemas listing file contains *relative* paths to the schema files use
`-p` option to specify the absolute path prefix.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2swig -i schemas_list.txt -p /path/to/schemas/dir
```

### Output Directory
By default the output CMake project is written to the current directory. It
is possible to change that using `-o` option.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2swig -o /some/output/dir schema.xml
```

### Injecting Custom Code
The **commsdsl2swig** utility allows injection of custom code into the
generated project in case the default code is incorrect and/or incomplete. For this
purpose `-c` option with path to directory containing custom code snippets is used.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2swig -c /path/to/custom/code/snippets schema.xml
```
Please read [Custom Code](#custom-code) section below for more details on
how to format and where to place the custom code.

### Changing Main Namespace
The code generated by the **commsdsl2swig** depends on the code generated by
the **commsdsl2comms**. If the code generated by the **commsdsl2comms**
[changed its main namespace](Manual_commsdsl2comms.md#changing-main-namespace)
then it is required to change the main namespace for the code generated by
the **commsdsl2swig** as well.
```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2swig -n other_ns_name schema.xml
```

### Selecting Interface
When the protocol defines multiple interfaces, there is a need to select only
one that is applicable to the generated solution. To select appropriate
interface use `--force-interface` command line option.

```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2swig --force-interface Interface1 ...
```

### Using Subsets of Messages
The code generated by the **commsdsl2comms** contains definitions of all the
messages defined in the schema file(s). When the protocol is too big and/or
there are messages which are inapplicable to the created solution, they can be
excluded from the bindings support. To do so there is a need to
create a separate file listing all the messages IDs (using their full reference
strings including namespaced if applicable). Then the file with the messages
list can be provided using the `--messages-list` command line option.

```
$> /path/to/commsdsl2swig --messages-list /path/to/messages/list/file ...
```

## Custom Code
As was already mentioned earlier, **commsdsl2swig** utility allows injection
of custom code snippets in the generated code.
To better understand what code is injected where, it is recommended to
read through the [OtherLanguagesSupport.md](OtherLanguagesSupport.md) documentation
page first.

The generated _CMakeLists.txt_ does **NOT** contain any code applicable to set up
the required languages that need to be processed. The custom injected code is
expected to have the following files defined:

- **CMakeListst.txt.prepend** - Contain the lines required to find the necessary packages.
- **CMakeLists.txt.prepend_lang** - Contain the lines that sat appropriate swig flags based on the used languages.
- **CMakeLists.txt.append** - Contain the lines linking appropriate libraries to the generated compilation target.

Similar to the [custom code injection defined for the commsdsl2comms](Manual_commsdsl2comms.md##custom-code)
the relevant code snippets are expected to reside in the same relative path as the
generated code and to have specific extensions. Most useful are

- **.public** - Add extra public code to the class definition.
- **.private** - Add extra private code to the class definition.

For example:
- `include/demo/field/SomeField.h.public`
- `include/demo/field/SomeField.h.private`

The swig interface definition file itself (`<prot_name>.i`) allows injection extra
code at the beginning and at the end of files using `.prepend` and `.append`
files accordingly. Prepending can be useful to add some extra language specific
definitions if needed.

For example:
- `demo.i.prepend`
- `demo.i.append`
