# Generated CMake Project Walkthrough

This documetation page contains detailed information on what is being generated by the
**commsdsl2comms** utility. Please open one of the generated example projects,
such as [cc.demo1.generated](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated) in
a separate browser tab or clone the project to your PC and follow the description
below.

## Folders
The generated CMake project has multiple folders.

### Protocol Definition
The protocol definition itself is headers only library which can be found in
the [include](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated/tree/master/include) folder.

The common fields which can be referenced by multiple messages reside in the
[field](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated/tree/master/include/demo1/field)
folder / namespace.

All the message classes are defined in the
[message](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated/tree/master/include/demo1/message)
folder / namespace.

All the available transport frames are defined in the
[frame](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated/tree/master/include/demo1/frame)
folder / namespace.

The various generated input messages bundles reside in the
[input](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated/tree/master/include/demo1/input)
folder / namespace.

All the available auxiliary `switch` statement based message dispatch functions are
defined in various files in the
[dispatch](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated/tree/master/include/demo1/dispatch)
folder / namespace.

All the available compile time configuration options of the protocol reside in the
[options](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated/tree/master/include/demo1/options)
folder / namespace.

All the available auxiliary `switch` statement based message factory classes (suitable
for the replacement of the **comms::MsgFactory**) are defined in various files in the
[factory](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated/tree/master/include/demo1/factory)
folder / namespace.

### Protocol Documentation
The configuration of the doxygen documentation resides in the
[doc](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated/tree/master/doc)
folder.

## CMake Configuration.
Please open the main
[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt)
file. It should list all the available options and configuration variables,
something like this:
```
option (OPT_REQUIRE_COMMS_LIB "Require COMMS library, find it and set as dependency to the protocol library" ON)

# Other parameters:
# OPT_CMAKE_EXPORT_NAMESPACE - Set namespace for a protocol library
#     exported via generated *Config.cmake file. Defaults to "cc".
# OPT_CMAKE_EXPORT_CONFIG_NAME - Override default name "test1" of the cmake generated config file export
#     (test1Config) with provided new name.
```

The generated protocol code requires [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms). By
default the cmake configuration process will try to locate it using
```
find_package(LibComms REQUIRED)
```

The build process (which is just copying relevant files to the install directory) does not
really require presence of the [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms). If the
client code is going to provide relevant include directories by other means, then it is
possible to suppress the requirement for the presence of the
[COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms) during cmake execution.

```
cmake -DOPT_REQUIRE_COMMS_LIB=OFF ...
```

Also note that if search for the [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms) is **NOT**
excluded, it's directory should be listed in **CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH** variable

```
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/comms/install/dir ...
```

## Building Documentation
In addition to protocols headers installation, the CMake project also contains
target **doc_<proj_name>** to build doxygen documentation of the protocol.
For example for [cc.demo1.generated](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.demo1.generated)
it is **doc_demo1**:

```
$> make doc_demo1
```

## CMake Import
When built and installed the project exports and installs the cmake target definition of the protocol library in `<install_dir>/lib/<protocol_name>/<protocol_name>Config.cmake` file, that can be imported in some other project that uses CMake as its build system.
```
list (APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/path/to/protocol/install/dir")
find_package (demo1 REQUIRED NO_MODULE)
target_link_libraries (my_proj cc::demo1)
```
Note, that **cc::** is a default namespace for exported project. It is possible to change it using **OPT_CMAKE_EXPORT_NAMESPACE** cmake variable described earlier.

Also note that in case of excluding [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms) lookup during the protocol build process
it needs to be found separately and used inside `target_link_libraries()` invocation.
```
list (APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/path/to/cc_tools_qt/install/dir")
find_package (LibComms REQUIRED NO_MODULE)
target_link_libraries (my_proj cc::demo1 cc::comms)
```
Please also read [doc/CMake.md](https://github.com/commschamp/comms/blob/master/doc/CMake.md) documentation page
of the [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms) project for the overview on how to import the latter
in other CMake projects.
